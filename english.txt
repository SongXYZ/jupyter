Age has reached the end of the beginning of a word. May be guilty in his seems to passing a lot of different life became the appearance of the same day; May be back in the past, to oneself the paranoid weird belief disillusionment, these days, my mind has been very messy, in my mind constantly. Always feel oneself should go to do something, or write something. Twenty years of life trajectory deeply shallow, suddenly feel something, do it.The end of our life, and can meet many things really do?During my childhood, think lucky money and new clothes are necessary for New Year, but as the advance of the age, will be more and more found that those things are optional; Junior high school, thought to have a crush on just means that the real growth, but over the past three years later, his writing of alumni in peace, suddenly found that isn't really grow up, it seems is not so important; Then in high school, think don't want to give vent to out your inner voice can be in the high school children of the feelings in a period, but was eventually infarction when graduation party in the throat, later again stood on the pitch he has sweat profusely, looked at his thrown a basketball hoops, suddenly found himself has already can't remember his appearance.Originally, this world, can produce a chemical reaction to an event, in addition to resolutely, have to do, and time.A person's time, your ideas are always special to clear. Want, want, line is clear, as if nothing could shake his. Also once seemed to be determined to do something, but more often is he backed out at last. Dislike his cowardice, finally found that there are a lot of love, there are a lot of miss, like shadow really have been doomed. Those who do, just green years oneself give oneself an arm injection, or is a self-righteous spiritual.
At the moment, the sky is dark, the air is fresh factor after just rained. Suddenly thought of blue plaid shirt; Those were broken into various shapes of stationery; From the corner at the beginning of deep friendship; Have declared the end of the encounter that haven't start planning... Those years, those days of do, finally, like youth, will end in our life.
The horse is a hooved (ungulate) mammal,a subspecies of the family Equidae.The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature into the large,single-toed animal of today.Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC,and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC.Although most horses today are domesticated,there are still endangered populations of the Przewalski's Horse,the only remaining true wild horse,as well as more common populations of feral horses which live in the wild but are descended from domesticated ancestors.There is an extensive,specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts,covering everything from anatomy to life stages,size,colors,markings,breeds,locomotion,and behaviour.
Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight instinct.Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait:horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down.Female horses,called mares,carry their young for approximately 11 months,and a young horse,called a foal,can stand and run shortly following birth.Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four.They reach full adult development by age five,and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.
Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament:spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods",such as draft horses and some ponies,suitable for slow,heavy work; and "warmbloods",developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods,often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes,particularly in Europe.There are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today,developed for many different uses.
Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits,as well as in working activities such as police work,agriculture,entertainment,and therapy.Horses were historically used in warfare,from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed,using many different styles of equipment and methods of control.Many products are derived from horses,including meat,milk,hide,hair,bone,and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares.Humans provide domesticated horses with food,water and shelter,as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.
